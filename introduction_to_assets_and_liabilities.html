      <h2>What is Asset and Liability?<br>(Concept, Type & Relationship)</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Assets and Liability tend to play a very vital role in any business to ensure the profitability of a business. Assets are something that the company owns and liability is something that company owes. Differences between asset and liability are determined by the equity. If the amount or the number of assets are greater the liability the health of the business is good or if the condition is opposite the company faces some major issues that eventually take them to great loss.
    </p>

    <h3>Concept</h3>

    <h4>Assets</h4>
    <p>
      The term assets indicate various forms of resource that helps the business grow over time. It has a different meaning, concept based on the various needs of the business. In finance the assets are resources that have financial value that is important for a business.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      Total Assets = Liabilities (Accounts Payable) + Owner's Equity
    </div>

    <h4>Liability</h4>
    <p>
      The term liability is something that a business or an individual owes to another business or a person. In financial terms it's a debt that business owes to other businesses or organizations.
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      Total Liabilities = Assets (Accounts Receivable) - Owner's Equity
    </div>

    <h3>Types</h3>
    <p>
      The following offers a detailed explanation of the different types of assets and liabilities.
    </p>

    <h4>Type of assets</h4>
    <p>Most assets are classified based on 3 broad categories, namely -</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Convertibility</td><td>Depending on their extent of convertibility, they are further divided into fixed assets or current assets.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Physical existence</td><td>Comprise assets that are both tangible and intangible.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Purpose</td><td>Depending on their purpose of use, they are categorised as operating and non-operating assets.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Following are the 6 different types of assets-</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Current Assets or Short-term Assets</b><p>Current assets are the types of assets that can be readily converted into cash or its equivalent resources typically within a year and are known as liquid assets. For example, cash equivalents, stock, marketable securities and short-term deposits are some of the most common current assets.</p></li>
      <li><b>Fixed Assets or Long-term Assets</b><p>Also known as hard assets and fixed assets, these resources are not easy to convert into cash or its equivalent kind. Generally, land, machinery, equipment, building, patents, trademarks, etc. are considered as fixed assets.</p></li>
      <li><b>Tangible Assets</b><p>Assets with a physical existence are categorised as tangible assets. Resources like stock, land, building, office supplies, equipment, machinery and marketable securities, among others are functioning examples of tangible assets.</p></li>
      <li><b>Intangible Assets</b><p>On the contrary, assets which do not possess a physical existence come under the category of intangible assets. The best examples of such assets would be market goodwill, corporate intellectual property, patents, copyrights, permits, trade secrets, brand, etc.</p></li>
      <li><b>Operating Assets</b><p>Assets like cash, building, machinery, equipment, copyright, goodwill, stock, etc. are termed as operating assets. Typically, such assets are used to generate revenue and to maintain daily operation.</p></li>
      <li><b>Non-Operating Assets</b><p>Though these assets are not used for performing daily operations, they tend to help generate significant revenue. Some of the best examples of non-operating assets are short-term investments, vacant land, income generated through fixed deposits, etc.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Type of Liability</h4>
    <p>Liabilities can be divided into 2 broad categories of internal and external liability -</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>Internal Liability</td><td>Comprises obligations like capital, accumulated profits and salaries, among others.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>External Liability</td><td>Includes payables like taxes, overdrafts, creditors and borrowings.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Liabilities are divided into further more category those are -</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Current Liabilities (The "Short-Term" Bills)</b><p>These are debts the company must pay off within one year.</p><ul><li><b>Why they matter:</b> They are like your monthly utility bills or grocery credit. If a company can't pay these, it might go out of business quickly.</li><li><b>The "Health Check":</b> Investors subtract these from what the company owns (Current Assets) to see if the business has enough "Working Capital" to keep running day-to-day.</li><li><b>Common Examples:</b><ul class="sub"><li><b>Trade Payables:</b> Money owed to suppliers for materials.</li><li><b>Bank Overdraft:</b> When the bank account goes below zero.</li><li><b>Short-term Loans:</b> Small loans due very soon.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
      <li><b>Non-Current Liabilities (The "Long-Term" Debt)</b><p>These are debts that the company has more than a year to pay back.</p><ul><li><b>Why they matter:</b> These usually fund big things, like building a new factory or buying expensive machinery. It shows how much the company is "borrowing" versus "owning" to grow.</li><li><b>The "Health Check":</b> Used to see if the company is drowning in debt or if it can safely manage its long-term growth.</li><li><b>Common Examples:</b><ul class="sub"><li><b>Mortgages:</b> Long-term loans for land or buildings.</li><li><b>Bonds/Debentures:</b> Large sums of money borrowed from the public or investors.</li><li><b>Deferred Tax:</b> Tax that will be paid in future years.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
      <li><b>Contingent Liabilities (The "Maybe" Debts)</b><p>These are "Wait and See" liabilities. They aren't definite debts yet; they depend on a future event.</p><ul><li><b>The Rule:</b> Accountants only write these down if there is at least a 50% chance the company will actually have to pay.</li><li><b>Common Example:</b><ul class="sub"><li><b>Lawsuits:</b> If a company is being sued, they might have to pay $1 million, or they might win and pay $0. Until the judge decides, it's a contingent liability.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Relationship between Assets and Liability</h3>
    <p>
      In business, maintaining a proper balance between assets and liabilities is essential to keep a company profitable. This relationship helps us understand how well a company can handle its internal and external obligations and how easily its assets can be converted into cash. It also helps in measuring the liquidity of a business, which shows its ability to meet short-term financial needs.
    </p>

    <h4>Financial Ratios</h4>
    <p>
      Financial ratios are tools used to understand a company's financial health. They help measure liquidity, debt position, and the owner's share in the business.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Current Ratio</h4>
    <p>The current ratio shows a company's ability to pay its short-term debts using its current assets.</p>
    <div class="formula">Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities</div>
    <h4>2. Acid-Test Ratio (Quick Ratio)</h4>
    <p>The acid-test ratio measures how well a company can meet short-term liabilities using quick assets, excluding inventory.</p>
    <div class="formula">Acid-Test Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities</div>
    <h4>3. Cash Ratio</h4>
    <p>The cash ratio shows a company's ability to pay short-term obligations using only cash and cash equivalents.</p>
    <div class="formula">Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities</div>
    <h4>4. Debt Ratio</h4>
    <p>The debt ratio indicates how much of a company's total assets are financed through debt.</p>
    <div class="formula">Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets</div>
    <h4>5. Owner's Equity</h4>
    <p>Owner's equity represents the owner's claim on the business after all liabilities are paid.</p>
    <div class="formula">Owner's Equity = Total Assets – Total Liabilities</div>
